        Visit the Taj Mahal: This world-famous mausoleum was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife Mumtaz Mahal. It’s widely considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, and it’s certainly worth a visit when you’re in India. We went independently, but you can definitely join a tour if you’d like.

    One of Amritsar's greatest attractions and its spiritual hub is the Sri Harmandir Sahib, commonly known as the Golden Temple. This is the holiest temple in the Sikh faith. Guru Ramdas Sahib, the 4th of 10 Sikh gurus, constructed the temple and its pool in the 1500s as a place of worship for all.
